# Introduction to Algorithm

- An algorithm is a step-by-step solution to any real-life problem.
- An algorithm is a sequence of instructions that can act on some input data to produce some output, within the limited number of steps.
- Algorithm is independent of any programming language.
- An Algorithm is not a complete code or program. it is the solution to any problem that can be expressed using pseudo code.

## Characteristics of Algorithm

- Input:
    - An algorithm must have either zero or a limited amount of input.
- Output:
    - At least one output must be generated by any algorithm.
- Definiteness:
    - Every step in the algorithm must be clear and straightforward.
- Finiteness:
    - An algorithm must be completed in a limited number of steps.
- Effectiveness:
    - Every step of an algorithm must be effective or have some meaning.
- Correctness:
    - For every input, an algorithm should produce the correct output.
- Feasibility:
    - An algorithm must be feasible [possible to implement].
- Independence:
    - An algorithm should have step-by-step direction which should be independent of any programming code.
