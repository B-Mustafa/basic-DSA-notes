1. Primitive Data Structure

- The primitive data types are the fundamental datatypes.
- Example: Int Float Double, Char
- Now in the primitive, there are two types,

  - 1. Numeric:

    - Int: Numbers with positive, negative values and whole numbers basically not decimal
      - Example: 23,6,0,1
    - Real numbers or float numbers: These represent numbers having decimal points.
      - Example: 1.5, 3.534, 0.43

  - 2.  Non Numeric:

    - CHAR: character type of data.
      - Example: a to OR A to Z
    - Pointer: It is a datatype that represents the memory address of a variable. Pointers can also be used to access the memory address of a variable.

  - 3.  Booleans: AKA logical,
    - It can represent value either as TRUE or FALSE.
      - 0 = False, 1 = True

2. Non Primitive Data Structure

- These can be derived using any primitive datatype
- There are two types of Primitive Datatype

  1. Linear Data Structure:

     - Array:
       - It is a collection of similar kinds of data.
     - Stack:
       - In data structure, insertion and deletion are performed at one end only.
       - It is also known as LIFO [Last in First out]

     - Queue:

       - In data structure, insertion at one end and deletion at the other end.
       - It is also known as FIFO [First in First out]

     - List:
       - A list can be defined as a collection of variables of a number of items.

  2. Non-linear Data Structure:

     - Tree: [We'll learn more about this in upcoming lectures]

     - Graph:
       - It is a collection of vertices (Node) and edges.
